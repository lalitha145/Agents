## What Are AI Agents?
Agent is a class that uses an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take.
In Chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded. In Agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.

Agents select and use Tools and Toolkits for actions.

An AI Agent is a program that can:

1. Think: It processes the information and makes decisions (using AI, like GPT)
2. Act: It performs actions, such as sending an email, fetching data, or solving a problem.
3. Adapt: Some agents can learn or improve based on experience (optional, but powerful).

Think of it like a smart assistant:

You tell it what you want, and it figures out how to get it done using tools or by solving problems step by step.

## Key Features of AI Agents
1. Autonomy: They act on their own after being given a goal.
2. Reactivity: They react to changes or feedback while working on a task.
3. Proactivity: They don’t wait—they take action and complete the task for you.
4. Tool Usage: Agents often rely on external tools (APIs, databases, or even apps like Google or email).

Example:

If you ask an agent to "book a flight to New York," it might:
- Search flight options (use APIs).
- Compare prices (analyze data).
- Book the best one (take action).

## Agent Components (The Basics)
Here’s how agents work under the hood:

1. Input: You give it a task, like "find me the weather for tomorrow."
2. Reasoning: It plans how to solve the task.
3. Action: It uses tools (like APIs or search engines) to complete the task.
4. Output: It gives you the result or solves your problem.

## How Do You Use Agents in Practice?
Let’s say you want to build your first agent. Here’s how it works:

1. Define the Goal (What Should It Do?)
    Example: Create an agent that summarizes news articles.

2. Pick Tools (What Will It Use to Work?)
    Tools: APIs or libraries that help the agent do things.
    For our example, the agent could use:
    - A web scraper (to fetch the article).
    - GPT (to summarize the content).

3. Choose a Framework
    Frameworks help you build agents faster. Popular ones include:
    - LangChain: Makes building AI agents easier by connecting reasoning, tools, and memory.
    - AutoGPT: Prebuilt, but advanced. It creates agents that work on tasks autonomously.
    - OpenAI Functions: Simple if you’re using GPT models.

4. Write the Code
    Here’s a super simple example of a Python agent using OpenAI’s GPT:
    ```python
    from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

    # Step 1: Set up the language model (GPT)
    llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

    # Step 2: Add a tool (search engine in this case)
    search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

    # Step 3: Initialize the agent
    tools = [Tool(name="Search", func=search_tool.run, description="Use to search the web.")]
    agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

    # Step 4: Give it a task
    agent.run("Summarize the latest news about climate change.")
    ```
    What this does:
    - The agent uses GPT to think about the task.
    - It uses the search tool to find news articles.
    - It outputs a summary.

5. Test and Improve
    - Run your agent and see if it works.
    - Add more tools or tweak it to handle different kinds of tasks.

## How Can You Use Agents in Everyday Life?
Here are a few beginner-friendly ideas:

- Personal Assistant: Automate scheduling or email responses.
- Data Fetcher: Get stock prices, weather, or news automatically.
- Content Creator: Write summaries, blogs, or code snippets.
- Automation: Perform repetitive tasks like form-filling.
